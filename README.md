# RustOS
An Operating System in The Rust Programing Language
## Note:
I am stopping development for the time being as I am currently considering making a YBCO superconductor and I need some time to research a procedure and crunch some numbers :)

### Bugs:
1. PageTableManager catastrophic faliure MapMemory while loops in kernel.rs either crash or go infinitely 

### Info:
the actual code is in the RustOS Branch also when you compile this you need to be on linux if anyone thought differently

### Credits:
current bootloader from PonchoOS guide (cuz I got lazy + I ain't making a bootloader in Rust)
